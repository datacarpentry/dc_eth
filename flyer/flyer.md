# Data Carpentry Workshop  
### August 19 - 22, 2015, Faido, Switzerland


__Organizers__: Frank Pennekamp, Owen Petchey, Philippe Saner (University of Zurich)      
__Instructors__: Karthik Ram, Berkeley (Institute for Data Science) 
                 Fran√ßois Michonneau (University of Florida)  

Data Carpentry workshops are for any researcher who has data they want to analyze, and no prior computational experience is required. This hands-on workshop teaches basic concepts, skills and tools for working more effectively with data. We will cover data organization in spreadsheets, data cleaning, the command line, and R for data analysis and visualization using examples from biology. Participants should bring their laptops and plan to participate actively. By the end of the workshop learners should be able to more effectively manage and analyze data and be able to apply the tools and approaches directly to their ongoing research.

Data Carpentry's aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools for working with data so that they can get more done in less time, and with less pain.
